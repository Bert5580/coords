coords v2.0.0 â€” 2025-10-16 22:38:57
----------------------------------------
* Rebuilt as clean FX-standalone resource
* Removed auto-open on start; UI opens only on /coords
* Added proper NUI focus and ESC handling
* Added Copy & Refresh (re-capture) buttons
* Prints coords to console; optional chat message on copy
* Added key mapping command 'coordstoggle' (unbind by default)
* Defensive nil checks and safe rounding/formatting
* No busy loops; UI-only when shown
* Graceful cleanup on resource stop
